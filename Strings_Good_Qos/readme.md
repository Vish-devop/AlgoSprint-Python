Some Good Questions found over strings. 

1. Check if a string is palindrome or not, by continusly removing the first and last character of the string. 

2. Even Length Palindrome Check: Write a function that checks if the middle two characters of a string (if the string has even length) are the same. If so, return true; otherwise, return false.

3. First Half Palindrome: Given a string, return true if the first half of the string is a palindrome. If the string has an odd length, ignore the middle character.

4. Longest Palindromic Substring: Write a function that takes a string and returns the longest palindromic substring within it.

5. Count Palindromic Subsequences: Write a function that counts the number of palindromic subsequences in a given string.

6. Substrings of Length N: Create a function that generates all substrings of a given length n from a string. Then, return how many of those substrings are palindromes.

7. String Compression: Implement a function that compresses a given string by converting sequences of the same character into their counts (for example, "aaabbb" into "a3b3"). Then, check if the compressed string is a palindrome.

8. Remove and Check Palindrome: Given a string, repeatedly remove the first and last character until the string is less than 4 characters. Return true if any of those substrings is a palindrome.

9. Adjacent Palindrome Check: Write a function that checks if a string can be split into two parts such that both parts are palindromes.

10. Anagram of Palindrome: Write a function to check if a given string can be rearranged into a palindrome (i.e., if any of its permutations is a palindrome).

11. Mirror Palindrome: Check if a string reads the same backward and forward using only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases. Return true if it is a "mirror palindrome".

## Bonus Challenging Problems
12. Palindrome Partitioning: Given a string, determine all the possible palindrome partitioning of the string. For example, inputting "aab" should return [["a", "a", "b"], ["aa", "b"]].

13. Minimum Cuts for Palindromes: Given a string, find the minimum number of cuts needed to partition the string into substrings, each of which is a palindrome.

1. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:

2. Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Anagrams:

3. Given two strings, check if they are anagrams of each other (i.e., can be rearranged to form each other).
String Compression:

4. Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3".
Group Anagrams:

5. Given an array of strings, group the anagrams together.
Longest Palindromic Substring:

6. Given a string, return the longest palindromic substring in it.
Check if One String is Rotation of Another:

7. Given two strings, check if one string is a rotation of the other (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").
